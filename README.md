This project aims to create a functional DOS that runs on modern computers, developed exclusively using Assembly language.

# Author
This project is being developed independently by a 14-year-old developer.

# Structure
The project consists of image files (`.img`) and source files, organized into folders by version. 
**The latest version of the `.img` file is located in the root project folder for easy access.**

# How to Run
1. Create a new virtual machine in VMware.
2. Add a Floppy Drive to the created VM.
3. Load the `os.img` file into the floppy drive.
4. Power on the VM to run.

# Commands
- `ver`: Displays the current version.
- `clear`: Clears the screen.
- `exit`: Exits the system.

# Bug Reports
If you encounter any issues, please contact: coding0101bus@gmail.com

# Side Note
When you run the exit command, the message "It's now safe to turn off your computer." will appear.

**This is not a bug.**
Shutting down modern hardware using only Assembly in a DOS environment is extremely complex. Therefore,
this message is provided as a guide; you may simply turn off your computer (or VM) manually at that point.
